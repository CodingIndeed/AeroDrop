# AeroDrop-Precision-Drone-Delivery-with-ARuco-Marker-Landing-and-Obstacle-Avoidance
AeroDrop is an autonomous drone delivery system that navigates real-world coordinates, avoids obstacles using LiDAR, and precisely lands on an ARuco marker with a max deviation of 7 cm. Built with ROS, MAVLink, and OpenCV, it runs in Gazebo with ArduPilot and can be deployed on real drones with minimal changes.
